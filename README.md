# The Untitled Brick Game

This repo contains the code and images I used to create the first iteration of my alternative controller game. This is still a work in progress and I will continue to contribute to this repo as I build this project. 

In this game players try to free a spirit trapped inside of a brick by rotating the brick along the x,y, and z axes. The rotation of the brick controls the passage of time in the game. 

This project uses websockets to send data from an accelerometer to a webpage hosted on a Raspberry Pi. You can view images and a detailed build log [here](https://forums.balena.io/t/make-a-wireless-alternative-controller-game/344115) .
